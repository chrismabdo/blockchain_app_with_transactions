### What Exactly is Blockchain?
a public database where new data are sotred in a container called a block and are added to an immutable chain.
In the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, these data are groups of transactions. But, the data can be of any type.

Gives rise to digital currencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, and distributed computing in the form of technologies like Ethereum, which has introduced concepts like smart contracts.

First block is referred to as the GENESIS Block

## Mining
To control the difficulty of mining new SnakeCoins, we’ll implement a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. A Proof-of-Work algorithm is essentially an algorithm that generates an item that is difficult to create but easy to verify.
